            The word guess game: Mission Moon</h4>
            <p>This game is developed for entertainment and educational purposes.
              The concept of this game is derived from famous Hangman game. The 
              neglect for hangman game, to a large extent was also due to the changed
              sensibilities of society over time. ‘Hangman’ is not considered 
              appropriate in a school classroom setting anymore. Hence the 
              game was not updated either technologically or in its user interface.
              
              Therefore, We have develop same game with diffrent concept
              known as Mission Moon.
